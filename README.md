Calculator for osteoporosis fracture risk.

### Osteoporosis Calculator
A tool for calculating osteoporosis fracture risk.

---

#### To Do:

##### Appearance:

- **Risikogruppen Buttons:**
  - Increase spacing between buttons.
  - Should be collapsed by default upon HTML load.
  
- **Bugfix:**
  - Currently requires two clicks instead of one to collapse Risikogruppen; requires fix.

- **Ergebnis Section:**
  - Points for individual groups should be hidden or optionally viewed (perhaps behind a button), especially during the debugging phase.
  
##### Functionality:

- **Grouping Adjustments:**
  - Groups need to be summarized according to DVO definitions:
    - Fall-risk-associated diseases
    - Glucocorticoids and rheumatoid arthritis (Assigned to Maxi for implementation/fix)
  - correcting/specifying labels of items in the Risikogruppen
  -

#### Note
Please ensure that all group definitions and calculations align with the most recent and scientifically valid DVO guidelines.
